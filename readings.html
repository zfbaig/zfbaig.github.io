                </div>
            </div>

            <div id="description">
                Though this text was a little confused to wrap my head around, I am intrigued by the thought that Mail
                Art is almost combatting or confronting larger bureaucratic structures(?), the Big Monster. I find it
                almost amusing how he describes Mail Art as a part of guerrilla war against this "Big Monster", but is
                this not a statement one can make about any/all art? All art no matter how small, has some sort of
                message or purpose- if it has no message, that is its purpose- to have no message. Art throughout
                history can and has been a tool to be 'political' and 'provoking' to a certain extent- pushing on the
                boundaries of society in some way. So what makes Mail Art so different? What makes it so special is what
                I am wondering? Maybe I just didn't pick up on it well enough in the text, but aren't all these
                declarations he's making about Mail Art applicable to all art? .

            I am intrigued by this idea that websites are "living, temporal spaces", that are both the subject and
            object, and can be used as a tool for a "self-reflexive feedback loop". And with this, websites are tools
            for creativity, identity and purpose. But a few questions I have, and would like to pose are:
            <ul>
                <li> Through this class and in general, what are some practical ways we can make websites feel more
                    "alive" and "personal"? In what ways can we creatively reflect our identity and creative vision?
                    Like every
                    medium of art, once one understands the tools can they feel like they are able to communicate what
                    they
                    truly want (or that might just be)

                <li> How can artists truly overcome/reclaim the internets potential that is currently ran by large
                    corporations? In what specific ways can artists attempt to do this?
                <li> Does social media set constraints and diminish the potential for creativity? Or does it set
                    constraints that can challenge and push more creativity? (I personally find the creativity grows
                    when given
                    structure and constraints)

                    While doing this reading, I found myself looking at the geocities archives and found some very
                    interesting websites upon browsing. I felt like I was looking at a time capsule or a screenshot of
                    people at specific points in their lives. I found myself looking at this website a lot and starting
                    having questions about where this person is right now, or if he's even aware that his website is
                    still up in the archives. Anyways, I found it really entertaining and recommend others look at the
                    Archives as well.
                    <a href=https://geocities.restorativland.org/CollegePark/Lounge/1359/home.html>(Apparently you can

                <div id="description">
                    This weeks reading, which emphasizes our current "post-digital" era, I was intrigued by the contrast
                    between the concept of books and music with that of print. This reading argues books and music are
                    "abstract rather than material – ... a symbolic form which is able to migrate" and change mediums to
                    e-books, Internet streaming, and back to their physical manifestations of physical books, CDs,
                    vinyls, etc. But print is its medium itself- "a physical carrier of information". I agree with this
                    ability to transform back and forth between mediums for books and music, most people prefer to read
                    for pleasure with print books, but prefer digital textbooks over print ones due to their convenience
                    -- it all depends on their use. People may stream music but still prefer to collect cassettes or
                    vinyls as nostalgic memorabilia. I intrigued by the idea that print cannot be abstract in these same
                    ways- and am able interested to see these "hybrid" forms introduced in the reading -- especially
                    ways QR codes could be used more creatively.

                    In what ways can the concept of QR codes be translated into different forms, and how can we "think
                    outside the box" with the QR codes use and potential?

                    Where can technology such as augmented reality (AR) play a role in these "hybrid prints"?

                    </div>

                    <div id="description">
                        I like that this reading is reframing the way we think about alt-text, but I’m still of
                        grappling with the idea of treating it as poetry. Alt-text does indeed involve creativity and
                        intentionality, but doesn’t all writing? What makes alt-text more poetic? The authors argue that
                        thinking of alt-text as poetry makes us more aware of language, tone, and word economy, which
                        makes sense, but at what point does the poetic approach become impractical? Alt-text is first
                        and foremost an accessibility tool, so if it gets too experimental or abstract, does it risk
                        becoming more about the writer’s artistic choices than the clarity and function of the
                        description? I guess my key point is, how much artistic freedom should be given in relation to
                        its practicality and functionality.

                        <p>The authors push back on the idea that alt-text should strive for objectivity, but isn’t that
                            a key part of the functionality? It may bring a more creative and artistic approach to those
                            visually impaired, giving them something to unpack, but if a description is too personal or
                            interpretive, doesn’t it start imposing meaning rather than just conveying information?
                            However, that's the case with all creative writing, no? I found myself oscillating between
                            these two ideas often during this reading. The example about describing a smile—do you say
                            “lips turned up at the corners” or just “smiling”? One is technically more objective, but
                            does it actually provide a better understanding? I guess my question is: where do we draw
                            the line between making alt-text engaging and keeping it useful for the people who need it
                            most?</p>

                    <div id="description">
                        I found this week's reading to be especially compelling for a few different reasons. You don't
                        often think about your biases and what you take for granted- but as a native English speaker
                        reading this text, I was able to quickly see the problems that surround me that I wasn't aware
                        of (or simply did not think of) before. As someone who's family speaks Urdu (written in
                        Perso-Arabic script), has been to various parts of the Middle East, and can read Arabic, I have
                        seen those broken, disconnected letters many times, which always looked awkward to me because
                        when I learned to read Arabic, everything was always connected, and read from right-to-left.
                        However, I never really thought much of it, expect when I did a project once on illustrator and
                        got so frustrated with the Arabic text, I just opted to use a png of the calligraphy instead.
                        Visually in text spaces, this is a constant reminder that digital spaces were not built with
                        Arabic readers in mind.

                        However, even in creating those digital spaces or any programming, this continues in the form of
                        a language barrier. The thought that there is a sort of "inescapability" of English in computing
                        is frustrating, especially after reading about Nasser's attempt to create a fully functional
                        Arabic programming language like قلب (Qalb). The fact that a fully functional Arabic programming
                        language like قلب still can’t survive on a large scale because it has to interact with
                        English-based tools makes me wonder: is a truly non-English computing system even possible
                        anymore, or has the ship already sailed? And why has no one still not tried to solve the problem
                        with Arabic scripts in the digital world?

                    <div id="description">
                        The reading’s discussion of Gestalt principles made me think about how much of design is about
                        perception rather than just placement. We group things together instinctively—proximity,
                        similarity, continuity—but is that something designers have actual control over, or is it just
                        how our brains work regardless of intention? The reading makes it seem like designers are
                        orchestrating this experience, but I wonder: is design more about guiding interpretation or just
                        working with cognitive defaults that exist anyway?

                        I also found the idea of design as a system of communication really compelling. The comparison
                        to language makes sense—typography, layout, composition all function like grammar and syntax.
                        But if design is a language, does that mean it’s also just as prone to misinterpretation? With
                        words, ambiguity can be intentional, but in design, does unclear communication always mean bad
                        design? Or are there cases where ambiguity actually makes something more engaging?

                        The tension between structure and chaos was another thing that stood out. Design seems to be
                        about finding a balance—too rigid and it’s lifeless, too unstructured and it’s overwhelming. But
                        I wonder if this balance is more of a moving target than a fixed rule. For example, a brutalist
                        website with clashing colors and unexpected spacing would traditionally be considered bad
                        design, but in the right context, it can be deliberately disruptive and effective. So where’s
                        the line? When does breaking the “rules” make a design more compelling, and when does it just
                        make it unreadable?

                                The line, "The importance of [Frenkel's] artistic practice for the history of new media
                                art ... is central to a critical reinterpretation of the field as one that encompasses
                                the complexity of memory in the digital realm and questions our investment in the
                                phantasmagoric screen as the archival repository of an eternal present rather than
                                recognizing it as a cipher for what losses haunt our historical consciousness," (49)
                                really struck me and was a good summary of the way my concept of memory was challenged.
                                The idea that “the past only arrives when the future has been built to contain it” (49)
                                feels like it can be adapted to almost everything and everyone - from whole countries to
                                individuals. History and memory is important to move forward- but those archives,
                                whether physical or digital, don’t just hold history but actively shape how (or if) it’s
                                remembered. I will "vaguely" remember something when I was younger, but then after
                                thinking about it longer, did I remember it for did I see photos of it and then
                                interpreted it as a memory? Which made me think--- If digital archives shape memory, how
                                much do we trust them? And to what extent does digital media, as both an archive and an
                                experience, shapes what (and how) we remember?

                                    Paul Soulellis in Performing the Feed mentions the idea of a “new boredom”. One
                                    where we “ desire a “god” view as a collective subject, becoming the they who does
                                    the observing instead of the me being seen.” This ‘new boredom’ makes us mistakenly
                                    feel like we are the ones in power and in control, when in reality we are the ones
                                    being watched, impacted, molded, and brain-washed with content. The power we feel
                                    from the “endless scroll” is addictive, and creates a never ending cycle where we
                                    continue to participate and interact with the “feed”, and thus are feeding others
                                    our information, time, and space. All of which are forms of power. This power is
                                    then capitalized and further exploited by getting fed into algorithms that group
                                    people- creating echo chambers, endorsing the spread of misinformation, continuously
                                    and endlessly stimulating us with things we, according to the algorithm, will engage
                                    with. No human is unbiased, and thus no algorithm is unbiased. Each algorithm serves
                                    a purpose, whether we agree with it or not. Algorithms are made to exploit our
                                    attention and consciousness for the sake of monetization- so any post we see is in
                                    part due to whatever the person/people funding this monetization/in power want us to
                                    see and engage with. As someone who grew up with social media, it became almost a
                                    part of my social life. If I go out and look nice, we always have to take photos and
                                    post it. Whenever we are bored, we open instagram or TikTok. Lately this has been
                                    called “doomscrolling” - a word that has even been added to the Merriam Webster
                                    Dictionary as: “to spend excessive time online scrolling through new or other
                                    content that makes one feel sad, anxious, angry, etc.”, but in a more broad sense
                                    its really the first part - “to spend excessive time online scrolling”, almost to
                                    the point of exhaustion, and even past that. As many my age can probably relate,
                                    breaking away from the ‘feed’ is difficult. It has started to play the role of an
                                    escape from responsibilities, reality, or the things I need to face. And it has
                                    continuously programmed us to use it and rely on it. I agree that we need to
                                    “de-focus our gaze… [and] teach ourselves new ways to see”, because from now it will
                                    only really be getting worse. This reading was from 2017, and then he was already
                                    predicting “future feeds that surround us with limitless realities” and fictional
                                    scenes “indistinguishable from live events.” And now, in 2025, we are already seeing
                                    a glimpse of this future. With AI and Deep Fakes, we are left questioning what is
                                    real and fake - and soon it will be fully “indistinguishable.” Paul Soulellis
                                    suspects that “in order to better recognize and understand the entanglement of
                                    power, automation, simulation, and algorithmic media, … we need to train ourselves
                                    at the outer limits of perception.” But what does that mean? What does that look
                                    like? He suggests archiving as a form of resistance against this ‘flow of the feed’,
                                    but in what other ways can we do this? How do we “teach ourselves new ways to see”-
                                    especially after participating the feed takes a large part of our lives? How do we
                                    rewire ourselves after this addiction has been programmed into our lives?

                                        “The Way” made me think of how easily we accept software updates, even when
                                        they’re quietly rewriting the way we interact with the world—and ourselves. I
                                        too, felt a lot of discomfort with the master/slave terminology, but it was
                                        necessary to sit with. It was really interesting to me how much of computing is
                                        built on language and systems rooted in control, and how normalized that’s
                                        become.

                                        What I loved most was the shift at the end—how “The Beyond” wasn’t a place, but
                                        a feeling, a memory, a community. That line, “community is memory,” made me
                                        think: what if real tech isn’t the software, but the people and stories we share
                                        with each other?

                                        <div id="description">
                                            This reading truly covered a lot of content, the core of which was
                                            discussing the shift of art and literature as fiction to nonfiction. In the
                                            analogue-dominated world, one would escape when looking at a painting or
                                            reading a book, but now on the internet - it seems all real because the
                                            internet functions as a medium of information placed offline. While the
                                            internet provides a revolutionized ability to access and globalization- it
                                            sacrificed intimacy and authenticity. This "globalization" and "free access"
                                            causes us to live in fear of others thoughts- though it democratized speech
                                            and art, it also gave way to noise and echo chambers. I remember hearing
                                            artists on instagram struggle to create art for themselves, struggle with
                                            the "algorithm", and put almost equally the same amount of time put into a
                                            piece into documenting it- for views, likes, and shares. I agree with
                                            Jean-Paul Sartre' state emit that "hell is other people" and that we both
                                            prisoner to the gaze of the other (180-181). The internet as it functions
                                            goes directly against the whole idea of "autonomy of the subject" that
                                            people try to attain now-- as everything is documented, monetized, and used
                                            for algorithms. He states that the relationship between the internet as an
                                            archive - looking specifically at politics and art is that - politics shapes
                                            the future by its disappearance and art shapes the future by its prolonged
                                            presence- which leaves a gap that could be bridged by looking at our past in
                                            a new lens. Groys suggests that perhaps in the efforts to look at our past
                                            in a nonhistoicist approach, the internet's ability to recontextualize and
                                            decontextualize can strengthen archives utopian potential and weaken its
                                            potential for betraying the utopian promise.
